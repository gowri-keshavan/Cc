✅ Task 1: Install the Cloud Logging and Monitoring Agents

📍Objective:

Install Cloud Logging Agent and Cloud Monitoring Agent, and enable Apache monitoring plugin.


---

🛠️ Steps:

1. Open Cloud Console → Go to VM instances.


2. SSH into the VM named something like instance-1.


3. Install Cloud Logging agent:



curl -sSO https://dl.google.com/cloudagents/add-logging-agent-repo.sh
sudo bash add-logging-agent-repo.sh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y google-fluentd
sudo service google-fluentd start

4. Install Cloud Monitoring agent:



curl -sSO https://dl.google.com/cloudagents/add-monitoring-agent-repo.sh
sudo bash add-monitoring-agent-repo.sh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y stackdriver-agent
sudo service stackdriver-agent start

5. Enable Apache plugin:



(cd /etc/stackdriver/collectd.d/ && sudo curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Stackdriver/stackdriver-agent-service-configs/master/etc/collectd.d/apache.conf)
sudo service stackdriver-agent restart

6. Go back and click Check my progress ✅

✅ Task 2: Add an Uptime Check for Apache Web Server on the VM

📍Objective:

Create an uptime check to verify your Apache server is running.


---

🛠️ Steps:

1. Go to Monitoring → Uptime checks → Create Uptime Check.


2. Set the following:

Title: Apache Check

Protocol: HTTP

Resource Type: VM instance

Applies to: Single (choose the correct instance)

Path: /



3. Click Test to verify it's working.


4. Click Create.


5. Go back and click Check my progress ✅




---

✅ Task 3: Add an Alert Policy for Apache Web Server

📍Objective:

Create an alert when traffic > 3 KiB/s, notify by email.


---

🛠️ Steps:

1. Go to Monitoring > Alerting → Create Policy.


2. Under Add Condition:

Resource type: VM Instance

Metric: apache/httpd/bytes_per_second

Filter: (optional) use instance name

Configuration: “is above” 3 KiB



3. Under Notification Channels:

Add your email if not already listed.



4. Name the policy: Apache Traffic Alert


5. Click Create Policy



📤 Generate traffic:

SSH into the VM again and run:

timeout 120 bash -c -- 'while true; do curl localhost | grep -oP "<title>.*</title>"; sleep .1s;done'

You may run it again to trigger the alert faster.


6. Go back and click Check my progress ✅

✅ Task 4: Create a Dashboard and Charts

📍Objective:

Create a dashboard with two charts:

1. CPU Load (1m)


2. Apache HTTP Requests




---

🛠️ Steps:

1. Go to Monitoring > Dashboards → Create Dashboard.


2. Name it: Apache Dashboard



📈 Chart 1 – CPU Load:

Add chart → Line chart

Resource type: VM Instance

Metric: CPU Load (1m) (compute.googleapis.com/instance/cpu/utilization)

Save chart


📈 Chart 2 – Apache Requests:

Add chart → Line chart

Resource type: VM Instance

Metric: apache/httpd/requests

Save chart


3. Save dashboard


4. Go back and click Check my progress ✅




---

✅ Task 5: Create a Log-Based Metric

📍Objective:

Create a metric filtering for:

Resource type: VM Instance

Log name: apache-access

Payload: textPayload:"200"



---

🛠️ Steps:

1. Go to Logging > Logs Explorer


2. Enter this filter:



resource.type="gce_instance"
logName="projects/PROJECT_ID/logs/apache-access"
textPayload:"200"

> Replace PROJECT_ID with your project (lab auto-fills it)



3. Click "Create Metric" (above the logs preview).


4. Name it: apache-200-metric


5. Type: Counter


6. Unit: 1


7. Save the metric


8. Go back and click Check my progress ✅
